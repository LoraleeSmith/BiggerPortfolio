                <p>Hello, my name is Loralee Smith. I have a background in Cosmetology but over time I wanted
                    something
                    different
                    but still creative. In the mean time of finding out what I want to do I got an Associate's degree in
                    Social
                    Behavior and another in General Buisness Management. I really wanted to work from home and I had
                    messed
                    around
                    with creating a website and blog on Wix.com but learned that
                    I didn't know how to really set it up how I wanted and was envisioning. Thus, I enrolled in UCDavis
                    Web
                    Development coding bootcamp. Through this course I am learning the techniques and proper coding and
                    systems
                    to
                    make my creative visions come to life. I hope to help
                    others bring their dream come to life as well. I enjoy working with sytlists to create beautiful web
                    portfolios
                    of their work, stunning web
                    portfolios for my photograpghy friends to display their work and much more.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">I like to work more on portfolios for artists whether that's tattoos, cosmetologists,
                    photograpghers, models, etc. I have two personal blogs in the works; one on lifestyle and one on
                    hair.
                    After working on my first project - Moodsphere, I'd like to work on more mental health projects as
                    well.
